On OS X 10.4 and later, the system uses a slick little utility called "launchd" to manage system
processes. Launchd will automatically start processes at startup or on demand, monitor them, and
restart them if they die.

You can configure launchd to launch moat on startup, and keep it running. Just do:

    sudo cp moat.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
    sudo cp chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/moat.plist

Moat will then launch on startup. To launch it immediately:

    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/moat.plist
    
To stop it (until the next reboot):

    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/moat.plist
    
To stop and restart it immediately (e.g. if you make configuration changes):

    sudo launchctl stop moat

To restart it weekly, in order to flush out old rules for hosts which are no longer attacking:

    33 3 * * tue /bin/launchctl stop moat
